<span style="Font-size:1.17em;"> In today's digital age, fraud detection has become an essential aspect of financial transactions. With the increasing volume of transactions, it's crucial to develop robust methods for identifying fraudulent activities to protect both consumers and businesses. This project focuses on understanding the impact of transaction characteristics on fraud detection by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing various transaction features, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This will help financial institutions minimize losses and enhance the security of their transaction systems. </span>

### Project Overview:
- **Objective:** Understand the impact of transaction characteristics on fraud detection and develop a predictive model.
- **Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Transaction Data, souced by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anurag629/credit-card-fraud-transaction-data). 

    **Dataset Features:**
    - Transaction ID: Unique identifier for tracking transactions.
    - Date: Date of the transaction.
    - Day of Week: Day of the week when the transaction occurred.
    - Time: Time of the transaction.
    - Type of Card: Type of credit card used (e.g., Visa, MasterCard).
    - Entry Mode: Mode of entry for the transaction (e.g., Tap, PIN, CVC).
    - Amount: Transaction amount.
    - Type of Transaction: Nature of the transaction (e.g., POS, Online, ATM).
    - Merchant Group: Category of the merchant.
    - Country of Transaction: Country where the transaction occurred.
    - Shipping Address: Shipping address provided for the transaction.
    - Country of Residence: Country of the cardholder's residence.
    - Gender: Gender of the cardholder.
    - Age: Age of the cardholder.
    - Bank: Bank that issued the card.
    - Fraud: Indicator of whether the transaction was fraudulent (1) or not (0).

### Business Problem/Hypothesis:
- Identify key transaction characteristics indicative of fraudulent activity.
- Assess the impact of entry modes, demographic factors, and transaction types on the likelihood of fraud.
- Hypothesize that specific transaction characteristics and well-developed predictive models can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

---

### Methods/Analysis
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned data, handled missing values, converted columns to appropriate data types, and performed summary statistics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  Visualized distributions and relationships within the data.

### Results
- **Model Performance:**  Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression with high precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

| Model               |Precision (Class 0) | Precision (Class 1) | Recall (Class 0) | Recall (Class 1) | F1 Score (Class 0) | F1 Score (Class 1) |ROC-AUC             |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------  |--------------------|--------------------|
| Logistic Regression |     1.00           | 0.54                | 0.93             | 0.95             |0.96                | 0.68               |0.9819
| Random Forest       |     0.98           | 0.97                | 1.00             | 0.81             |0.99                |0.88                |0.9922

*Class 0 - Non-Fraudulent / Class 1 - Fradulent*


- **Feature Importance:** The feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model revealed that the top predictors of fraudulent transactions included temporal (time of transaction), geographic (country of transaction), and transaction amount features.

### Conclusion

This study utilized HR analytics to predict and enhance employee performance, identifying key performance drivers and evaluating HR strategies. The top predictors of performance were previous year ratings, average training scores, and length of service. Recruitment channels and the quality of training programs also significantly impacted performance.

**Practical Applications:**
1. **Optimizing Recruitment:**
   - Strengthen high-performing channels like 'Other' and 'Referred.'
   - Improve sourcing strategies with rigorous screening and aligned job descriptions.
2. **Enhancing Training Programs:**
   - Focus on quality and relevance.
   - Develop tailored and interactive training.
   - Offer continuous learning opportunities.
3. **Leveraging Key Predictors:**
   - Improve performance reviews.
   - Create targeted development programs for training scores and service length.
4. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Implement regular check-ins, 360-degree feedback, and performance dashboards.
5. **Predictive Model Implementation:**
   - Use the Gradient Boosting model to predict performance.
   - Integrate it into HR systems for real-time insights.
   - Update it with new data regularly.

Implementing these strategies can enhance performance, productivity, and work environment. This study highlights the value of HR analytics for strategic decisions and underscores the importance of data-driven HR strategies for organizational success. Future research should address limitations and explore additional features to improve predictive accuracy.
