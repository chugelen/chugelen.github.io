I am a dedicated data science student at Bellevue University, set to graduate in August 2024. Based in Southern California, I am passionate about working remotely to travel and explore the world with my family. 

I thrive on transforming *data chaos* into **clarity**, bringing a detail-oriented approach to every project I undertake. I have evolving knowledge of working with tools like Python, SQL, and various data visualization tools.

Currently, I am collaborating on three exciting projects:  
- predicting and enhancing employee performance
- analyzing transaction characteristics of credit card fraud
- studying the impact of reviews on Airbnb booking rates
