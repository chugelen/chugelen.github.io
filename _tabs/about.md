### About Me

Hi, I'm Cali T Hugelen, a dedicated data science student at Bellevue University, set to graduate in August 2024. Based in Southern California, I am passionate about working remotely to travel and explore the world with my family. 

I thrive on transforming data chaos into clarity, bringing a detail-oriented approach to every project I undertake.
